# Visual-Matrix-Operators
## A page that visualizes matrix operators!

### How to use:
- After the page has loaded, there are random numbers being generated and stored in the two matrixes <strong>A</strong> (the first one) and <strong>B</strong> (the last one).
- You can choose to change one of the grey cells if you like!
- After that, there are three buttons - Add, Subtract and Multilply, which will show what the resultant matrix will look like if <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> went through the operations.
