Minecraft Like Replica using Three.js!

This is a three.js simulation of a Voxel World with player movement functionalities. My first time trying something like this so don't expect it to be fantastic, still learning about it :)

More updates to come!

Use the W,A,S and D keys to move and press 'Space' to jump!
